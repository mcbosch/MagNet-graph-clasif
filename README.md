# MagNet for Graph Clasification

This repository is design of a Graph Neural Network for the classification of graphs. This GNN is aimed to work with directed graphs, but also works with undirected graphs. 
In order to design this GNN, we used the Magnetic Laplacian since in node-levels and edge-level performed well, see [MAGNET](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11391) for more detailed 
information. We used a similar idea, but changing the readout. THIS CODE IS NOT FINISHED YET.

Future objectives: 
- Define a Convolution over graphs that express local features and structures from a graph
- Investigate on optimitzation algorithms, allowing to design complex Poolin layers
